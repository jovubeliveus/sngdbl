---- This directory contains the following file:

- Makefile	: Makefile to build sngdbl executable (Intel Fortran)
- Makefile.gfortran : this Makegile is equipped for gfortran
- README	: This file
- sngdbl	: Executable for Linux 1.1
- sngdbl.f	: Fortran source file for the benchmark
- tick.f	: Timing routine based on 'date_and_time' intrinsic
- tick_.c	: Timing routine based on 'getrusage' (legacy code)



---- What it does:

sngdbl is meant to be a simple benchmarking program for CG-like
applications. There are two 
	matrix-matrix
routines, one of them is with loop unrolling (in order to test its
effect), one 
	matrix-vector
routine with a sparse matrix (in Ellpack-Itpack format) such that
indirect adressing is needed, two
	vector-vector
routines, one axpy and one dotprodukt routine.
